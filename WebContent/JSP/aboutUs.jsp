	<p>The world today is a global village and people are its citizens. 
	 As boundaries of location, people and time cease to exist, it is of utmost importance that we move with the times. 
	 At Sri Chaitanya, we have created a unique blend of world-class curricula, contemporary teaching methodologies, and equal focus on intellectual, physical and personality development, resulting future leaders who are ready to take on the world.
	 Today, we stand as the force behind creating countless world-class doctors, engineers, IAS officers, chartered accountants, and so much more.</p>
